# Hi, I'm Marco 👋

Italian 🇮🇹 **Backend Developer** based in Germany 🇩🇪.

I work mainly on **backend services** using Java and Python, with a strong interest in system design. I build small developer tools to make my work easier.
I also enjoy working on side projects and research, including **applied machine learning** and **network security experiments**.
